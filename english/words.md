**Since the dawn of human ingenuity**, people have **devised** ever more cunning tools to cope with
work that is dangerous, boring, burdensome, or just **plain nasty**. That **compulsion** has resulted in
robotics**—**the science of **conferring** various human capabilities **on** machines. And if scientists have **yet**
to create the mechanical version of science fiction, they have begun to come close.

As a result, the modern world is increasingly **populated** by intelligent **gizmos** whose presence we
barely notice but whose universal existence has removed much human labor. Our factories **hum to the**
**rhythm** of robot assembly arms. Our banking is done at **automated teller terminals** that **thank** us with
mechanical politeness **for** the transaction. Our subway trains are controlled by **tireless** robot-drivers.
And thanks to the continual **miniaturization** of electronics and micro-mechanics, there are already
robot systems that can perform some kinds of brain and bone surgery with submillimeter accuracy**—**
**far** **greater** precision **than** highly skilled physicians can achieve with their hands alone.

But if robots **are to** reach the next stage of laborsaving **utility**, they will have to **operate** with less
human supervision and **be able to make at least a few decisions for themselves**—goals that pose a real
challenge. “While we know how to tell a robot to handle a specific error," says Dave Lavery, manager
of a robotics program at NASA, “we can't yet give a robot enough ‘**common sense**’ to reliably interact
with a dynamic world.”

Indeed the **quest** for true artificial intelligence has produced very mixed results. **Despite** a spell of
initial optimism in the 1960s and 1970s **when it appeared that** transistor circuits and microprocessors
might be able to copy the action of the human brain by the year 2010, researchers lately have begun to
**extend** **that** forecast **by** decades **if not** centuries.

What they found, in attempting to model thought, is that the human brain's roughly one hundred
billion nerve cells are much more talented—and human perception far more complicated—than
previously imagined. They have built robots that can **recognize** the **error** of a machine panel **by** a
fraction of a millimeter in a controlled factory environment. But the human mind can glimpse a rapidly
changing scene and immediately disregard the 98 percent that is irrelevant, instantaneously focusing
on the monkey at the side of a **winding** forest road or the single suspicious face in a big crowd. The
most advanced computer systems on Earth can't approach that kind of ability, and neuroscientists still
**don’t** know **quite** how we do it.
